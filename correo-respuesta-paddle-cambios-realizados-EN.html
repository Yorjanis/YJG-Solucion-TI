            <p>Hello Lara,</p>
            
            <p>I hope you are doing well. I am writing to you in reference to your email from [DATE] where you explained the reasons for the initial rejection of my Paddle application.</p>
            
            <p>I have conducted a thorough review of my website and have implemented all necessary changes to ensure full compliance with Paddle's Acceptable Use Policy and Terms and Conditions. Below, I detail the main changes made:</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ec0f0f; margin-top: 25px;">Changes Implemented:</h3>
            
            <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 20px;">1. Removal of Prohibited Human Services</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> I removed all references to "Training included" and "Training and consulting" from all product pages (mobile applications, desktop applications, web applications, and web pages).</li>
                <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> I completely removed all mentions of consulting services in product plans and features.</li>
                <li><strong>Customized Platforms:</strong> I replaced "Full customization" and "Optional customization" with "Advanced configuration" and "Flexible configuration available", focusing on product features, not customized services.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 20px;">2. Update of Technical Support References</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I changed all references from "Technical support included" to "Complete documentation included" or "Documentation and resources included" across all pages of the site.</li>
                <li>This was applied to: main page, product pages, blog pages, terms and conditions, and privacy policy.</li>
                <li>The focus is now on documentation and resources that are part of the product, not human support services.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I reviewed and updated all customer testimonials to remove references to "customer service", "implementation process", and "software implementation".</li>
                <li>Testimonials now focus exclusively on the quality of software products, features included in licenses, and ease of use of the product.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 20px;">4. Update of General Descriptions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I changed all footer descriptions from "Specialists in application development..." to "Specialists in business management software. Software products with licenses and subscriptions available...".</li>
