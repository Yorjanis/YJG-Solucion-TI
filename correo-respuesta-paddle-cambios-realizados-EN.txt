Subject: Review Request - Changes Implemented According to Acceptable Use Policy

Hello Lara,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to you in reference to your email from 12/15/2025. where you explained the reasons for the initial rejection of my Paddle domain.

I have conducted a thorough review of my website and have implemented all necessary changes to ensure full compliance with Paddle's Acceptable Use Policy and Terms and Conditions. Below, I detail the main changes made:

Changes Implemented:

1. Removal of Prohibited Human Services
   - Training: I removed all references to "Training included" and "Training and consulting" from all product pages (mobile applications, desktop applications, web applications, and web pages).
   - Consulting: I completely removed all mentions of consulting services in product plans and features.
   - Customized Platforms: I replaced "Full customization" and "Optional customization" with "Advanced configuration" and "Flexible configuration available", focusing on product features, not customized services.

2. Update of Technical Support References
   - I changed all references from "Technical support included" to "Complete documentation included" or "Documentation and resources included" across all pages of the site.
   - This was applied to: main page, product pages, blog pages, terms and conditions, and privacy policy.
   - The focus is now on documentation and resources that are part of the product, not human support services.

3. Update of Testimonials
   - I reviewed and updated all customer testimonials to remove references to "customer service", "implementation process", and "software implementation".
   - Testimonials now focus exclusively on the quality of software products, features included in licenses, and ease of use of the product.

4. Update of General Descriptions
   - I changed all footer descriptions from "Specialists in application development..." to "Specialists in business management software. Software products with licenses and subscriptions available...".
   - This was applied consistently across all pages of the website.

5. Update of Terms and Conditions
   - I updated the Terms and Conditions to explicitly mention that Paddle acts as our authorized reseller and Merchant of Record.
   - It clearly specifies that Paddle handles payment processing, automatic billing, subscription renewals, and tax compliance.
   - I included the link to Paddle's Buyer Terms.

6. Update of Privacy Policy
   - I removed references to "technical support" and replaced them with "documentation".
   - I added a specific section mentioning that we share information with Paddle as our authorized reseller and Merchant of Record for payment processing and tax compliance.

Current Focus of the Site:

My website now focuses exclusively on:
✅ Ready-to-use software products (mobile applications, desktop applications, web systems, web page templates)
✅ Software licenses and SaaS subscriptions
✅ Documentation and resources included with products
✅ Paddle as authorized reseller and Merchant of Record

I have completely removed all references to:
❌ Custom development services
❌ Consulting
❌ Training
❌ Implementation services
❌ Technical support as a human service

Files Modified:

I updated a total of 11 files on my website, including:
- Main page (index.html)
- Product pages (mobile applications, desktop, web, web pages)
- Blog pages
- Terms and Conditions
- Privacy Policy
- Footer on all pages

All changes were applied in both Spanish and English to maintain consistency.

Review Request:

I have carefully reviewed Paddle's Acceptable Use Policy and I am confident that my website now meets all requirements. The site focuses exclusively on selling digital software products with licenses and subscriptions, which is a fully permitted use according to Paddle's policies.

I would like to request a new review of my website. I am available to provide any additional information you may need or to clarify any aspect of the changes made.

My domain is: yjgsolucionti.com

I look forward to your response and thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
